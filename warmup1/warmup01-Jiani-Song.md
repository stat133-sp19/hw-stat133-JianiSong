B. Cooking Recipe
=================

### [Sticky sesame chicken wings](https://smittenkitchen.com/2014/07/sticky-sesame-chicken-wings/)

### 1. Ingredients:

-   3 pounds chicken wingettes or chicken wings
-   1 large garlic clove, minced
-   1 teaspoon coarse or kosher salt, plus more to taste
-   2 tablespoons soy sauce
-   2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
-   2 tablespoons mild honey
-   1 teaspoon Asian sesame oil
-   Pinch of cayenne or dash of Sriracha
-   1 1/2 tablespoons sesame seeds, lightly toasted
-   1 scallion, finely chopped

### 2. Tools needed:

-   Large bowl
-   Tray with rack
-   A good kitchen knife
-   Chopping Board
-   Fying Pan/ skillet
-   Measuring spoons
-   Grater for grating the ginger
-   Wooden or Silicon coated spoons

### 3. Steps:

1.  Preheat the oven to 120C/250F and place a rack on a large baking tray.
2.  Cut each wing at the joint so you have a mini wing and a drumette. Dry the wings with paper towels, then place in a large bowl and add the baking powder, salt and pepper. Toss to combine. Note - it's important to dry the wings first so they only get a light coating. Discard any remaining coating once tossed together.
3.  Place in a single layer on the rack, skin side up. It's fine for them to be touching. Place on the lower shelf of the oven for 30 minutes.
4.  After 30 minutes, turn the oven up to 220c (425f), rotate the tray and place on a higher shelf in the oven for 45-50 minutes until the wings are golden and crispy. Take out of the oven to cool slightly.
5.  Place all of the sauce ingredients into a saucepan, stir and bring to the boil. Allow to bubble for 5-10 minutes until the sauce reduces and thickens slightly (it will thicken more as it cools). Turn off the heat.
6.  Place the wings in a large bowl and very carefully pour over the sticky sauce (be careful, it will VERY hot). Toss to combine, then serve topped with chopped spring onions.

### 5. Facts:

There is no special season for Sticky sesame chicken wings. They are served as finger food appetizers for an ourdoor party or as the main course for a family dinner. **(All year round)**

### 6. Variation of the recipe:

You can add ***60 ml (1/4 cup) fresh lemon juice*** to the sauce, which will give chicken wings a more fresh and clean taste.

C. Euclidean Distance
=====================

### Definition:

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is th length of the line segment connecting them **($\\overline{pq}$)**.

In [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system), if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ⋯, *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ⋯, *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the [Pythagorean formula:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem)

$$ \\begin{aligned}
    d(\\textbf{p},\\textbf{q}) = d(\\textbf{p},\\textbf{q}) &= \\sqrt{(q\_1-p\_1)^2+(q\_2-p\_2)^2+\\cdots+(q\_n-p\_n)^2} \\\\
    &=\\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^{\\infty}(q\_i-p\_i)^2} 
  \\end{aligned}  $$

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector). So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **[Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm)**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$$  ||\\textbf{p}||= \\sqrt{p\_1^2 + p\_2^2 + \\cdots + p\_n^2 } = \\sqrt{\\textbf{p} \\cdot \\textbf{p}} ,$$

where the last expression involves the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).
